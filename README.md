# Log Management System - Homework Assignment

## Sample Log Data

Below are examples of the logs that will be processed by our system:

## Requirements

Create a complete log management system with the following components:

1. **Log Reading Tool:** Build a tool that reads logs from a file and sends them to a syslog server on a custom port.
1. **Syslog Server:** Develop a syslog server that listens on a custom port and performs the following actions when logs arrive:
    - Save each log to `/sb/logs/incoming/$year/$month/$day/$fromhost_ip/syslog.log` where `$year`, `$month`, `$day` are current date values and `$fromhost_ip` is the sender's IP address
    - Analyze log content and forward any logs containing "TRAFFIC" to a SIEM tool
1. **SIEM tool.**

## Evidence Required

Provide documentation with the following evidence:
- Output from the log reading tool showing the reading and forwarding process
- Screenshots or listings of saved log files in the correct directory structure on the syslog server
- Query results from the SIEM tool confirming that only TRAFFIC logs were received
- Explanation of your solution.

Please use own github repository.
